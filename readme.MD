## Name Changer

This script was created to automate the 
file changing process of PDF files during the school's 
result hour. 

### This code is just to demonstrate how simple python scripts can be largely helpful to automate these tedious tasks.

### Make sure to install the required dependencies

```bash
pip3 install -r req.txt
```
### Also make sure you add the correct path to your file and folder 

```python
workbook = load_workbook('path/to/the/workbook/') # location of the excel file

directory = 'path/to/the/directory' # location of the directory
```
